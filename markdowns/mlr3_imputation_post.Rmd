# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

This post is a part of a series about `mlr3`, see the other posts:

-   Create your first R Project: [link](https://nfoss2.github.io/mlr3_first_project_post)

-   Learn the right way to train simple models: [link](https://nfoss2.github.io/mlr3_models_post)

-   Learn how to impute missing values with pipelines (this post)

The purpose of this post is to introduce you to `mlr3` imputation and give an example of how to impute missing values using pipelines (showing the best practice methods), using the `palmer penguins` dataset. `palmer penguins` is a built in task described as "classification data to predict the species of penguins". Read more about the dataset [here](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_tasks_penguins.html).

## Set Up the Environment {#sec-set-up-the-environment}

To follow along with this post you will to run the following code chunk:

```{r}
set.seed(78)
# install.packages("mlr3")
library("mlr3")

# create task object
task = tsk("penguins")

# create a resampling object
cv = rsmp("cv", folds=10)

# create a performance measure object
measure = msr("classif.ce")
```

## Missing Values {#sec-missing-values}

Many data sets have missing values, this can cause issues with some learners. To see if your data set has missing values use `$missings()`

```{r}
task$missings()
```

## What is Imputation? {#sec-what-is-imputation}

**Imputation** is a method of identifying and handling (removing or replacing) missing values in a data set.

There are many different kinds of imputation, most have `mlr3` implementations. Short explanations of each are in this table.

## Create Pipeline {#sec-create-pipeline}

```{r}
# install.packages("mlr3pipelines")
library("mlr3pipelines")
```

For this post we will use a pipeline to automate the process, read about pipelines [here](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/pipelines.html). We will start by creating the necessary `pipeOps`.

1.  An Imputation method - for this example we will use `imputesample` (impute features by sampling).
2.  A learner - for this example we will use `classif.rpart` (decision tree).

```{r}
# imputation method
poImpute = po("imputesample")

# learner
poLearner = po("learner", learner = lrn("classif.rpart"))
```

Next we will create the graph that will impute features then train the learner

```{r}
graph = poImpute %>>% poLearner
graph$plot()
```

The next step is to make the graph into a graph learner so that we can use a resampling method.

```{r}
grlrn = as_learner(graph)
```

Now for the training step

```{r}
rr = resample(task, grlrn, cv)
```

Now that the training is complete we can see the performance of the model.

```{r}
rr$aggregate(measure)
```
